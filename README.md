# CentoTech

During this project, the C/C++ **firmware** for ESP8266 is developed and a **PCB** design is done for a vehicle tracking device.

1) **PCB**:
> - The PCB is designed in Altium Designer Software. The circuit is designed based on the ESP8266 wifi module and MC60 quad-band GSM/GPRS/GNSS module.

2) **Firmware**:
> - The firmware is developed using C/C++ in Arduino IDE and implemented on ESP8266. 
> - MC60 module is set up and configured using AT commands to send location data via SMS/Internet. 
> - An application-layer cryptographic protocol is designed and implemented for secure communication between the Device, Server, and Mobile Application.
